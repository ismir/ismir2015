				<h1>Guidelines for Reviewers</h1>

				<h3>TECHNICAL GUIDELINES</h3>

				<section>					

					<h3>Scheduling</h3>

					<p>As soon as you are notified of your assigned paper, 
					please check all of them to make sure that:</p>

					<ul class="contentblock-list">

						<li><div class="contentblock-item"><div class="marker"></div><p>

							there is no obvious conflict of interest (see 
							section on Conflict of Interest below)</p></div></li>

						<li><div class="contentblock-item"><div class="marker"></div><p>

							the number of assigned papers and the deadline allow 
							you enough time to complete your reviews (see 
							section on Commitment and Respect below)</p></div></li>

						<li><div class="contentblock-item"><div class="marker"></div><p>

							you are qualified to review the papers assigned</p></div></li>

						<li><div class="contentblock-item"><div class="marker"></div><p>

							none of the papers assigned to you violates any of 
							the paper submission guidelines</p></div></li>

					</ul>

					<p>Please notify the Program Committee immediately if any 
					issues arise regarding these points. Adhering to the 
					deadline is essential, since the Program Committee and 
					Chairs still have a huge amount of work to do after the 
					review process has been completed. It is advisable to read 
					papers well in advance before the deadline in order to have 
					time to think about them over a sufficiently long timespan 
					before writing your reviews. This is essential in order for 
					you to make thoughtful decisions about your assigned papers, 
					and to provide helpful suggestions for the authors.</p>

				</section>

				<section>					

					<h3>Evaluation Criteria</h3>

					<p>You will be asked to provide an evaluation of the papers 
					assigned to you according to the following criteria:</p>

					<ul class="contentblock-list">

						<li><div class="contentblock-item"><div class="marker"></div><p>

							Novelty of the paper</p></div></li>

						<li><div class="contentblock-item"><div class="marker"></div><p>

							Scholarly/scientific quality</p></div></li>

						<li><div class="contentblock-item"><div class="marker"></div><p>

							Appropriateness of topic</p></div></li>

						<li><div class="contentblock-item"><div class="marker"></div><p>

							Importance</p></div></li>

						<li><div class="contentblock-item"><div class="marker"></div><p>

							Readability and paper organization</p></div></li>

					</ul>

					<p>Keep in mind that minor flaws can be corrected, and 
					should not be a reason to reject a paper. However, accepted 
					papers must be technically sound and make an original and 
					substantial contribution to the field. Also, please 
					familiarize yourself with the information in the Call for 
					Contributions regarding the topics of the conference.</p>

					<p>When deciding your recommendation for a paper, do not be 
					shy. Use the whole spectrum of evaluation scores: if you 
					think a paper is outstanding, give it the highest score and 
					no less than that. Similarly, if you think a paper is really 
					bad (and can convincingly support your opinion), then give 
					it the lowest score and no more than that. Very often 
					reviewers tend to use intermediate scores, because they are 
					not entirely confident on their judgment, and/or because 
					they did not have time to read their papers thoroughly. This 
					attitude causes really good papers not to stand out, and 
					very bad papers not to be “caught”.</p>

					<p>Ensure that your scores are consistent with your comments 
					to the authors. In particular, receiving good comments and a 
					poor score is frustrating, and often causes the authors to 
					request clarifications or rebuttals.</p>

				</section>

				<section>					

					<h3>Comments for The Authors</h3>

					<p>Your comments for the authors are probably the most 
					important part of your reviews. They will be returned to the 
					authors, so you should include any specific feedback which 
					help improve the papers. Thorough comments also help the 
					Program Committee decide which papers to accept, sometimes 
					more than your score. Remember that your reviews are 
					evaluated by the Program Committee. Moreover, after the 
					completion of the review process, they will be available to 
					other reviewers of the same papers. Therefore your good work 
					will help generating a positive trend in the research 
					community.</p>

					<p>Short reviews are not helpful to either the authors and 
					the Program Committee. Please be as specific and detailed as 
					you can. When discussing related work and references, simply 
					saying “this is well known” or “this has been common 
					practice for years” is not appropriate. You should cite 
					publications, or other public disclosures of techniques, 
					which can support your statements. Be specific also when you 
					suggest improvements in the writing. If there is a 
					particular passage in the text that is unclear, point it out 
					and give suggestions for improvements. On the other hand, if 
					the whole paper is poorly written, you are not expected to 
					rewrite it for the authors.</p>

					<p>Be generous about providing new ideas for improvement. 
					You may suggest different techniques or tools to be used in 
					the applications presented in a paper. You may also suggest 
					the authors a new application area that might benefit from 
					their work. You may suggest them a generalization of their 
					concept, which they have not considered. If you think that 
					the paper has merits but does not exactly match the topics 
					of the ISMIR conference, please do not simply reject the 
					paper but communicate this to the Program Committee. These 
					papers will then be looked at and discussed with specific 
					care. Suggestions for alternative publication options that 
					are more appropriate in your opinion (journals, conferences, 
					workshops) are welcome.</p>

				</section>

				

				<h3>ETHICAL GUIDELINES</h3>

				<section>					

					<h3>Commitment and Respect</h3>

					<p>Remember that academic careers and reputations rely on 
					scientific publications. Therefore you have to be seriously 
					committed to your work as a reviewer.</p>

					<p>In the past there have been complaints about some reviews 
					being too sketchy and superficial, so that it looked like 
					the reviewer did not take the time to read the paper 
					carefully. A sketchy or casual review is a lack of respect 
					to the authors who have seriously submitted their paper, and 
					in the long run damages the ISMIR conference. If you have 
					agreed to review a paper, you should devote enough time to 
					write a thoughtful and detailed review. If you think you 
					cannot review properly your assigned papers because you are 
					too busy, you should not commit to your assignment. However, 
					please do communicate this to the Program Committee as soon 
					as possible so that the papers can be reassigned in time. 
					Acting that way you are helping much more than doing a 
					superficial review.</p>

					<p>Keep in mind that belittling or sarcastic comments are 
					not appropriate. Even if you think that a paper is really 
					bad, you should be constructive and still provide feedback 
					to the authors. If you give a paper a low score, it is 
					essential that you justify the reason for that score in 
					detail. Just saying “I do not like this approach because I 
					am a guru in this area” is not constructive. Also keep in 
					mind that directly talking about the authors can be 
					sometimes perceived as being confrontational, even though 
					you do not mean it this way. For this reason, you may want 
					to avoid referring to the authors by using the phrase “you” 
					or “the authors”, and use instead “the paper”.</p>

				</section>

				<section>					

					<h3>Confidentiality and Anonymity</h3>

					<p>As a reviewer you have the responsibility to protect the 
					confidentiality of the ideas represented in the papers you 
					review. Submissions to the ISMIR conference have not (or 
					should not have) been published before.</p>

					<p>Although the authors’ ultimate goal is to publish and 
					disseminate their work, a percentage of submitted papers 
					will not be accepted and published in the ISMIR conference 
					proceedings, and will most likely be submitted to some other 
					journal or conference. Sometimes a submitted paper is still 
					considered confidential by the author’s employers or funding 
					sources. In order to comply with confidentiality 
					requirements:</p>

					<ul class="contentblock-list">

						<li><div class="contentblock-item"><div class="marker"></div><p>

							you should not show your assigned papers (or their 
							accompanying material) to anyone else, including 
							colleagues or students, unless you have asked them 
							to help with your review.</p></div></li>

						<li><div class="contentblock-item"><div class="marker"></div><p>

							you should not use ideas from your assigned papers 
							to develop new ones until the paper has been made 
							public</p></div></li>

						<li><div class="contentblock-item"><div class="marker"></div><p>

							after completing your reviews you should keep all 
							copies of your assigned papers and accompanying 
							material strictly confidential; also you should not 
							use implementations you may have written and results 
							you may have obtained to evaluate the ideas in the 
							papers until they have been published and are 
							properly citable.</p></div></li>

					</ul>

					<p>Although some reviewers like to disclose their identity 
					to authors, it is advisable not to do so. One of the most 
					common ways of inadvertently disclosing your identity is 
					asking the authors to cite your past work and several of 
					your own papers. This should be avoided. Besides, this 
					attitude may have a negative effect on your review: it may 
					be seen as if you just want to gain more citations, and may 
					ultimately result in the authors just ignoring your review 
					(and possibly the Program Committee too).</p>

				</section>

				<section>					

					<h3>Conflicts of Interest</h3>

					<p>Even though you would judge impartially any paper 
					assigned to you, there has to be no doubt about the 
					impartiality of your reviews. Therefore, if there is a 
					potential conflict of interest with one of your assigned 
					papers, you should inform the Program Committee. Although in 
					general you should use your judgment, examples of situations 
					of potential conflicts of interest are the following:</p>

					<ul class="contentblock-list">

						<li><div class="contentblock-item"><div class="marker"></div><p>

							you work in the same research group as one of the 
							authors;</p></div></li>

						<li><div class="contentblock-item"><div class="marker"></div><p>

							you have been involved in the work and will be 
							credited in some way (e.g. you have hosted one of 
							the authors in your lab, to carry out work related 
							to the paper);</p></div></li>

						<li><div class="contentblock-item"><div class="marker"></div><p>

							you have formally collaborated (e.g., written a 
							paper together, or been awarded a joint grant) with 
							one of the authors in the past three years (more or 
							less);</p></div></li>

						<li><div class="contentblock-item"><div class="marker"></div><p>

							you were the M.Sc./Ph.D. advisor (or advisee) of one 
							of the authors: this is often considered to be a 
							lifetime conflict of interest;</p></div></li>

						<li><div class="contentblock-item"><div class="marker"></div><p>

							you have reasons to believe that others might see a 
							conflict of interest, even though there is none 
							(e.g., you and one of the authors work for the same 
							multinational corporation, although you work in 
							different departments on different continents and 
							have never met before).</p></div></li>

					</ul>

					<p>In case you have any doubt about a potential conflict of 
					interest, then rather decide that there is such a conflict 
					and contact the Program Committee.</p>

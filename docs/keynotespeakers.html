				Integrating music information sources for music production and consumption<br/>
                Mark Sandler </font></h1><p>

				<p> For several years, research at Queen Mary's Centre for Digital Music has probed the intersection of signal analysis technologies with informatics technologies. More specifically, we have built audio signal-level feature extractors which output RDF - the language of the Semantic Web - which have enabled us to build prototypes that expose enhanced functionality and offer new experiences to music users of all kinds. This talk will summarise some of our early and recent work in Semantic Audio and Music Informatics, leading up to the current research themes of our FAST-IMPACt (Fusing Audio and Semantic Technologies for Intelligent Music Production and Consumption) project. FAST-IMPACt is a 5 year programme of research involving 3 UK universities together with commercial and non-commercial partners from around the world. Its overarching aim is to bring more engaging and immersive experiences based on musical knowledge of all kinds to users of all kinds. Where relevant and possible, the principles will be illustrated with demos.

				<p><b>Bio</b> </p>
					<p>Mark Sandler was born in 1955. He received the B.Sc. and 
					Ph.D. degrees from the University of Essex, U.K., in 1978 
					and 1984, respectively. His PhD was an investigation into 
					Digital Audio Power Amplification and he has been an active 
					researcher in Digital Audio and Digital Music ever since. He 
					is a Professor of Signal Processing at Queen Mary University 
					of London, London, U.K., where he founded the Centre for 
					Digital Music and he has published over 400 papers in 
					journals and conferences and supervised over 30 PhD 
					students.</p>

					<p>He is currently Director of the EPSRC/AHRC Centre for 
					Doctoral Training in Media and Arts Technology, and 
					Principal Investigator of the 5 year research project, 
					Fusing Audio and Semantic Technologies for Intelligent Music 
					Production and Consumption.</p>

					<p>Mark is a Fellow of the Institute of Engineering and 
					Technology (FIET), a Fellow of the Audio Engineering Society 
					(FAES), a Fellow of the British Computer Society (FBCS) and 
					a Fellow of the Institution of Electronic and Electrical 
					Engineers (FIEEE).</p>

			     <a name="keynote2"></a><b><h1><font size=4><u>Keynote 2	</u>	<br/>			
					The promise of music information retrieval: Are we there yet? <br/>	
					J. Stephen Downie </font></h1><p>
					
					<p>In 1988 I needed to find some easy-to-play music for an upcoming flute performance exam.  As a famously mediocre flute player, I was more than 
					a little desperate to find something that would require the least amount of rehearsal time (and talent) to perform. I had previously played a baroque piece in the key of C that just might fit the bill. 
					After too many hours of searching that included innumerable consultations with infinitely patient music librarians and fellow music students, we finally determined that the work in  question was Bach's Flute Sonata 
					in C, BWV 1033.  This real-world use case inspired me to ask: "Why is it so difficult to identify, and then locate, a rather famous piece of music that I had actually played before?" In this talk, 
					I reflect on just how far music information retrieval research (MIR) has come in the intervening 27 years in making access to music resources quick and simple. As I expound on my personal journey as an MIR researcher, 
					I will note some of the twists in the road that I have surprised me. I will also offer up some commentary on lesser-travelled paths that we as community should explore.</p>


<p><b>Bio</b> </p>

					<p>J. Stephen Downie is the Associate Dean for Research and 
					a Professor at the Graduate School of Library and 
					Information Science at the University of Illinois at 
					Urbana-Champaign. Downie is the Illinois Co-Director of the 
					HathiTrust Research Center (HTRC). He is also Director of 
					the International Music Information Retrieval Systems 
					Evaluation Laboratory (IMIRSEL) and founder and ongoing 
					director of the Music Information Retrieval Evaluation 
					eXchange (MIREX). </p>

					<p>He was the Principal Investigator on the Networked 
					Environment for Music Analysis (NEMA) project, funded by the 
					Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.</p>

					<p>He is Co-PI on the Structural Analysis of Large Amounts 
					of Music Information (SALAMI) project, jointly funded by the 
					National Science Foundation (NSF), the Canadian Social 
					Science and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), and the 
					UK's Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC).</p>

					<p>He has been very active in the establishment of the Music 
					Information Retrieval (MIR) community through his ongoing 
					work with the International Society for Music Information 
					Retrieval (ISMIR) conferences. He was ISMIR's founding 
					President and now serves on the ISMIR board. Professor 
					Downie holds a BA (Music Theory and Composition) along with 
					a Master's and a PhD in Library and Information Science, all 
					earned at the University of Western Ontario, London, Canada.</p>
